# Software Engineering Resources

A collection of resources, cheatsheets and code snippets I found helpful (or kept forgetting) during my Flatiron Software Engineering bootcamp.

> HEY FRIENDS! This repo/resource is a perpetual work in progress. I'm not sure how big I want to expand it, but had a thought to include some resources I am gathering for my own knowledge. I'm open to suggestions or contributions.

## To-Dos

- What is the difference between `find`, `find_by` & `find_by_id`?
- Sessions
- RESTful routes
- Atom packages

## Algorithms

_Resources recommended by others in the community._

## Bundler

Run the following code to have bundler create a new Ruby project for you

```ruby
bundler gem name_of_your_project_repo
```

## Forms

A hidden input for editing or deleting data with a form

```
<input type="hidden" name="_method" value="patch">
```

## Git

- [Create a new empty branch in Git](https://gist.github.com/ozh/4734410)
- [How To Rename a Local and Remote Git Branch](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-rename-local-and-remote-git-branch/)

### Delete a Local Branch

```git
git branch -d BRANCHNAME
```

### Create a New, Empty Branch

```git
git checkout --orphan NEWBRANCH
git rm -rf .
```

### Resources

- [Changing a remote's URL](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/using-git/changing-a-remotes-url)

## Nokogiri

Open a new website for scraping

```ruby
Nokogiri:HTML(open("http://www.example.com"))
```

## Rake

See a list of all available Rake tasks.

```ruby
Rake -T
```

### Seed Data

1. Within the `db` folder, create a file named `seeds.rb`.
1. Create object instances. For example:
`Dog.create(:name => "Fido", :breed => "mutt")`. Using `create` as opposed to `new` creates the Ruby object _and_ saves it to the database
1. Run `rake db:seed`
