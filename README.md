# Software Engineering Resources

A collection of resources, cheatsheets and code snippets I found helpful (or kept forgetting) during my Flatiron Software Engineering bootcamp.

## Bundler

Run the following code to have bundler create a new Ruby project for you

```ruby
bundler gem name-of-your-project-repo
```

## Nokogiri

Open a new website for scraping

```ruby
Nokogiri:HTML(open("http://www.example.com"))
```

## Ruby

Substitute a character in a string for another character

```ruby
string.gsub("character-to-target","character-to-replace")
```
